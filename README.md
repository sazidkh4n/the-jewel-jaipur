## ðŸ“œ Project Overview

The project was developed in two main parts to create a comprehensive and scalable online store:

1.  **The E-commerce Engine (WordPress):** A fully functional and secure online store was built using WordPress and the WooCommerce plugin to handle all core business logic.
2.  **The Headless Storefront (React/Next.js):** A custom, modern user interface was developed using Next.js to provide a faster and more engaging user experience by fetching product data from the WordPress backend via its REST API.

### **Part 1: The WordPress Backend (E-commerce Engine)**

The backend was a complete online store with the following features:

- **Full Product Management:** Easy uploading and management of jewellery products, including images, descriptions, prices, and variations.
- **Secure Payment Gateway:** Integrated the CCAvenue payment gateway to handle online payments via credit/debit cards and also support Cash on Delivery (COD).
- **Live Shipping Integration:** Connected the Delhivery shipping service API for order fulfillment and tracking. A successful end-to-end test order was processed.
- **User Account Management:** Standard e-commerce features for customer registration, login, and order history.

**Technologies Used:** `WordPress`, `WooCommerce`, `PHP`, `MySQL`, `CCAvenue API`, `Delhivery API`

- **API Integration:** Successfully connected to the WordPress REST API to fetch and display product data in real-time.

## ðŸ“Š Project Status

Please note: The live hosting for the WordPress backend has expired, so the API connection is no longer active. However, the code in this repository represents the functional headless front-end. The project is currently paused.
